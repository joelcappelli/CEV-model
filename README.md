# CEV-model
The goal is to implement the valuation of European options in the so-called CEV
(Constant Elasticity Volatility) model, a simple extension of the Black-Scholes model specified by the
risk-free dynamics.

#### 1. Determine the analytical solution 
Value a European call under the CEV dynamics as a function of the spot S<sub>0</sub>, ùúÜ, ùõΩ, expiry ùëá, and strike ùêæ of the call.
Use the exact closed formula solution. An implementation of a displaced chi-square cumulative distribution is
necessary.

#### 2. Monte Carlo Solution
Implement a solution with Monte-Carlo simulations to price the option above. 
The goal is to design an object-oriented framework that is extendable to other models/options.
Things to think about
- discretisation step size
- log-transforming dynamics to ensure positivity
- parallelise using threads

#### 3. Finite Difference Method Solution
Use the Crank-Nicolson method to calculate prices to the price above.
Compare with the MC solution
- convergence of solution
- speed of execution
- margin of error to the exact analytical solution
